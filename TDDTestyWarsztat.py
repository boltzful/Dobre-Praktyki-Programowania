#Logging Setup: Configures logging to record timestamps, log levels, and messages.

#PaymentProcessor Class:

#processPayment: Checks if the payment amount is valid. If valid, it attempts to process the payment through gateway.charge(), logging success or failure.
#refundPayment: Attempts to refund a payment using gateway.refund(), logging the outcome.
#getPaymentStatus: Retrieves the payment status via gateway.getStatus() and logs it. Logs an error if thereâ€™s a network issue.
#Supporting Classes:

#PaymentGateway: Defines methods for charging, refunding, and checking status.
#TransactionResult: Holds transaction success, ID, and message.
#TransactionStatus: Contains COMPLETED and FAILED statuses.
#Exceptions: Define specific errors like NetworkException, PaymentException, and RefundException.
#In short, PaymentProcessor handles payment, refund, and status operations while logging and managing exceptions.
